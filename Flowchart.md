-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Data Understanding and exploration

# For reveling trends and seasonality--> line plots/bar charts/heatmaps

# Autocorelation plots_ Identification of the dependencies between observation at different time lags.

2.Feature Engineering and Selection 

#creation of new features to capture new important temporal dynamics.

#Identifying trends,seasonality or cyclic patterns for creation of features like

a)Moving Averages
b)lagged variables
c)cyclical indicators

#feature scaling - identifying the features to keep and features to remove

3.Model Selection and Evaluation 

a) Assesing the fit of the different models to data.

b) Plotting actual model prediction against actual variables to reveal 
a)biases
b)overfitting
c)underfitting

4.Anamoly detection

## Through visualisation}
a)via using the unsual patterns 
b)outliers detection

## Developing models for detection:
a)statististical
b)ml based
